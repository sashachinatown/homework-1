    <h1>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Guide to Character Progression</h1> 
    <h2>Introduction</h2> 
        <p>
            Like many RPG games, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has extensive character development and levels. Unlike many games, however, gaining levels doesn't give very many character stat benefits by itself. Witcher 3's character development is almost entirely based on an unlock-by-level system; the higher your level, the higher the level (and therefore stats) of the equipment that you can wear and the more skill slots you unlock, on top of the additional skillpoint per level. So to understand this you also need to understand the Equipment, Abilities and Mutagens that fuel it.
        </p> 
    <h2>Equipment</h2>    
    <p>
        Geralt's strength growth from equipment is fairly straightforward: the higher his level the higher the level of the equipment he can wear, and higher level equipment has better statistics. There are also several different grades of equipment for each level.

    <h2>Weapons</h2>
    <p>
        Your main tools for inflicting death on your opponents, and you'll be using them extensively. <br>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Steel Swords: Your primary weapon against non-magical enemies such as people and animals.
                Secondary Weapons: A mixture of weapon types including axes, staves and clubs, but despite the name you can't actually dual wield one of these with your steel sword; equipping one replaces your steel sword, and they often work differently.
            </li>
            <li>
                Silver Swords: Your primary weapon against magical/undead enemies. Going by the numbers these have significantly higher DPS values than equal level steel swords, but undead enemies have higher health to compensate for this so don't expect to mow through them quickly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Crossbow and Bolts: You obtain your first crossbow during your hunt for the Griffin, and interestingly enough you can still fire it with no bolts equipped; you have an unlimited number of basic bolts available which add the lowest possible damage boost to your shots. You can craft/find/buy better Bolts and equip them for more damage to your shots but Witcher 3 does have ammo consumption for the special bolts, so once you run out you'll have to get more or rely on the basic bolts alone. This will be your primary ranged weapon, however note that in general the Crossbow even with good bolts does significantly less damage than your swords, and even several of your Signs. Note also that the Crossbow can be used while you are piloting a boat and swimming underwater, and is in fact the only weapon or Sign that you can use while doing so. It also gets a massive damage boost while you're underwater or on the boat, becoming a one or two-hit kill weapon against most underwater/boatfaring enemies.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bombs: You have inventory quickslots to equip two of them. Forged through Alchemy and thrown like a grenade, there are various types of bomb that can damage or stun groups of enemies. Once created at least once you can restore your quantity of equipped Bombs through Meditation if you have alcohol in your inventory, however you can never hold large numbers of them and therefore won't use them heavily in combat, but there is one other key note on them: the Grapeshot and Samum grenades are among the only things that can destroy a Monster Nest, so make sure to have at least one of them on hand.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Some more advanced weapons also come with upgrade slots, allowing you to put in one of the sign Upgrade stones (explained further in the Armor section below) or one of the more powerful Runestones that can have one of a much wider variety of effects. Be careful of this though; once set you can only get either the Weapon or the stones back and not both, the other gets destroyed. At a craftsman, Remove Upgrade destroys the stones but keeps the weapon and Dissassembling the weapon gives you the stones (and crafting ingredients) at the cost of the weapon.
