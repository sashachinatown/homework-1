    <h2>Accessories/Consumables</h2>
    <p>
        On top of your armor and weapons you have an extensive array of supplementary equipment and items available to you, some of which actually get equipped on your horse Roach.<br>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Consumables: You have 4 quickslots available to you with hotkeys set on them for quick use, and you can equip any food or potions in them. This will be your primary source of healing for a fair chunk of the game.
            </li>
            <li>
                Saddle: Equipped on Roach and starting off with an initial basic one, this mainly determines the maximum Stamina Roach has when you have her go at a full gallop before she gets tired.
            </li>
            <li>
                Saddlebags: Also equipped on Roach, this mainly determines the maximum weight of items you can have in your inventory. Some items like herbs and quest items are considered weightless so you can have mountains of them in your inventory, but equipment isn't so you'll want a good set of Saddlebags to prevent yourself from having to go back to a merchant to sell your loot too frequently. If you are holding more weight of inventory than your max capacity you lose the ability to run and sprint while on foot; you can only move at a walk and do basic jumps. However, you can still ride and jump at full speed on Roach.
            </li>
            <li>
                Trophy: Usually a body part of some legendary monster that also gets equipped on Roach, fully visually rendered tied onto the side of your horse in all its gory glory, these give a variety of permanent passive effects such as increasing your chance of beheading enemies on a hit, boosting your experience gain, etc...you get your first one after defeating the Griffin.
            </li>
            <li>
                Horse Blinders: Equipped on Roach, this headpiece primarily reduces how quickly your horse's Fear meter grows in combat.
